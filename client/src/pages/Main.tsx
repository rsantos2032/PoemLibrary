        <h2>Young Cardinals</h2>
        Red birds bleed and blue ones die. That's the nature of this world of mine.
        <br/>
        No Song to sing nor hymn to cry. Just an aching heart and watery eyes.
        <br/>
        I hate love and lust and God and lies. I hate hummingbirds. The word "goodbye".
        <br/>
        But if you ask me now, beneath this sky.
        <br/>
        I can tell you why, the young cardinals fly.
